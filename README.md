# DockerInWSL

> ⚠️ This Project is deprecated! We decided to invest our ressources into existing docker-desktop alternatives like [rancher-desktop](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop) and [podman-desktop](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop). Please migrate to one of those solutions as soon as possible.

This Project is meant to be a minimal alternative to [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/). It uses WSL2 and a customized Ubuntu Container-Image as a lightweight replacement for the [Moby VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/linux-containers).

## How to install?

The easiest way is to use our private [WinGet](https://www.microsoft.com/p/app-installer/9nblggh4nns1#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) Repository. See [cloudflightio/winget-pkgs](https://github.com/cloudflightio/winget-pkgs) for details. 

> **Please verify that you have WSL2 installed and activated!** Verify that you got a 5.x Linux Kernel Version (preferable 5.10.x or later) installed. Run `wsl --status` to gather info about your WSL version. Try `wsl --install` and `wsl --update` to get the latest WSL install. See [WSL installation instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for more information.

> :information_source: You can uninstall the default Ubuntu distribution after the installation of DockerInWSL is completed using `wsl --unregister ubuntu`. It is not needed for DockerInWSL to work.

If you are one of the eager kind just execute the following in a privileged PowerShell window:

```powershell
winget source add --name cloudflight https://cloudflightio.github.io/winget-pkgs
winget source update --name cloudflight
winget install dockerinwsl
```

## How to use?

There are different ways to use Docker on Windows. 

### Wrapper Scripts

There are 3 cli-scripts that can be used to control docker in WSL. Just enter one of the following command inside a powershell or cmd window:

* [`docker`](msi/scripts/docker.bat): Simple bat-file wrapper for `wsl -d clf_dockerinwsl -- docker <args>`.
* [`docker-compose`](msi/scripts/docker-compose.bat): Also just a simple wrapper for `wsl -d clf_dockerinwsl -- docker-compose <args>`
* [`docker-wsl`](msi/scripts/docker-wsl.bat): A control-tool to interact with the wsl-distro and services inside it. For now it supports `start`,`stop`,`restart`,`show-logs` and `show-config`

### Direct WSL

Another way is to directly call Docker using the WSL binary:

* Open a Powershell window (no "As Administrator" needed).
* Navigate to the folder you want to use Docker in.
* Run `wsl -d clf_dockerinwsl -- docker ...` to execute the Docker CLI directly or
  use `wsl -d clf_dockerinwsl` to open a shell inside the docker-enabled WSL2 distribution.

> :information_source: You can also use `docker-compose` this way.

### IntelliJ

If you are using IntelliJ (like we do) it is quite easy to enable Docker with DockerInWSL:

* Press Services (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>8</kbd>) in the navigation bar at the bottom.
* Press Add Service (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Insert</kbd>) and select "Docker Connection".
* Give the connection a name and select "TCP socket" as the connection method.
* Set `tcp://localhost:2375` as the "Engine API URL" and hit OK.

Now you should be able to connect to Docker from within IntelliJ and control your Containers/Images/Networks/Volumes.

> :information_source: Make sure to call `docker-compose up` in the Linux environment with `wsl -d <Distro> docker-compose up -d`,
> because using IntelliJ IDEA for creation would execute `docker.exe`, causing errors as soon as you attempt to map volumes.

> :information_source: GUI actions for `docker-compose up` (e.g. "Run" icon in Docker Compose file editor)
> currently are not supported by IntelliJ if Docker binaries are stored/executed within WSL, which is the case with DockerInWSL.

#### Intellij 2023
Starting with IntelliJ 2023 you can directly connect to WSL to also start containers or run services directly from the docker-compose file. To set it up go to `Settings` -> `Build,Execution,Deployment` -> `Docker` -> `Connect to Docker daemon with: WSL` and select <kbd>clf_dockerinwsl</kbd> there.

Additionally, you can also configure the terminal to use wsl by using <kbd>wsl.exe -d clf_dockerinwsl</kbd> as Shell start command in `Settings` -> `Tools` -> `Terminal`


### TestContainers

We are using [TestContainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) quite a lot. After installing DockerInWSL
the environment variable `DOCKER_HOST` should be set to `tcp://localhost:2375`.
To make this change visible to all applications it is recommended to restart your machine.
A simple close and reopen of most Apps should be sufficient, but it's Windows right ;)

After that, TestContainers should recognize the installation and "just work".

## How to configure?

In some cases it might be necessary to configure part of DockerInWSL manually. There are special config-files located at `%APPDATA%\DockerInWSL\config` (you can use `docker-wsl show-config` to open the folder). Just edit them to your needs and restart the services using `docker-wsl restart`.

Currently the following config-files are available:

* `custom_dns.conf`: Additional dnsmasq config that can be used to add additional host-records or dns-servers. See https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/dnsmasq#DNS_server for more information on the config format
* `daemon.json`: This is the central docker daemon config file. You can, besides other settings, add insecure registries or change the default subnet if it collides with your network settings. Have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/cloudflightio/dockerinwsl/wiki) or the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file).

## How does it work?

This project is a result of our internal dev setup which uses Docker and TestContainers to provide a convenient way to work with cloud native environments.
We used "Docker Desktop" in the past but their [2021 policy change](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/) forced us to rethink that choice and we came up with an alternative solution.
Our new (this) setup uses WSL2 and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) with Docker to provide a simple replacement.
Currently, it does miss some convenience features, like a management GUI but should also be more lightweight and easier to use.

The whole installation process is handled by MSI and PowerShell. At its core, the installer is performing the following steps:

* Check whether a newer or the same version is installed. → Abort installtion if this is the case.
* Check whether WSL is installed properly. → Abort if no WSL2 install is found. (We decided to avoid installing it automatically because it can have some side-effects in complex environments)
* Copy all scripts and a TAR export of our [Container-Image](docker/Dockerfile) to `%PROGRAMFILES%\DockerInWSL`.
* Create the directory `%APPDATALOCAL%\DockerInWSL`, a startup Shortcut in `shell:startup` and some additional links in the start-menu all starting with "DockerInWsl".
* Set the `DOCKER_HOST` user environment variable to `tcp://localhost:2375`.
* Add the `%PROGRAMFILES%\DockerInWSL\scripts` directory to the users PATH variable.
* Run [install.ps1](msi/InstallScripts/install.ps1):
  * Check whether a DockerInWSL distribution is already installed in WSL2
    * If one is found, create a backup of `/var/lib/docker` and copy it to the Windows file system under `%APPDATALOCAL%\DockerInWSL\backup.tar.gz`. (We are working on a better way to handle this.)
    * After that, delete the current distribution using `wsl unregister <distro>`. This deletes the entire docker-storage and leads to a complete wipe (from a Docker point of view).
    * You might ask "Why not just leave the distribution be?": We are currently using the stock `dind` Image to reduce maintenance effort as much as possible. Using this makes in-place upgrades quite hard, we, therefore, decided to go "the docker way", using only destroy/recreate as update path. We might reconsider this in future versions but for now, it seems like the best approach.
  * Import the DockerInWSL TAR from `%APPDATALOCAL%\DockerInWSL\image.tar` to `%APPLOCALDATA\DockerInWSL\wsl` using `wsl --import`.
  * Check whether there is a file at `%APPDATALOCAL%\DockerInWSL\backup.tar.gz` and, if so, extract it. If this fails *do not* abort the installation because the old distribution is already gone. **If you find your WSL Docker empty after an update, check whether** `%APPDATALOCAL%\DockerInWSL\backup.tar.gz` **exists and try to extract it manually**
  * Finally, the startup script [docker-wsl.bat](msi/scripts/docker-wsl.bat) is called to start Docker.
* Additionally some registry keys are created to support proper updates/uninstalling using MSI.
